# Machine-Learning
Introduction to Machine Learning

I prepared this project as a part of my research tool. My approach will AI-ML-DL-Gen AI
Machine Learning- Works with Data

**Preporcessing and feature engineering**

-Real world data before feeding- feature engineering(raw data-encodding(categorical data like text data-yes/no data need encoding-label encoding/one hot encoding/ordinal encoding/binaryencoding/frequency encoding)  & binning (catgorical analysis)
-Scaling and Transformation- If numerical data in large number, need scaling. It helps faster calculation. Like standard scale, minmax scaler,robust scaler (outlier remove),maxabs scaler,log transformation (outlier and skewed data control), power transformation
-Text processing (Regex, Stemming,Tokenization, pos tagging, stop-word removal), and represtent in vectorization-(count, Tf-IDF, word to Vec, BERT Embedding).
-Dim reduction(PCA, filter method,embedded method, wrapper method)
-Feature creation(mathmetical combination, interaction, aggregation)- example- day, month, year separation.
-If imbalance data (increase pattern leads to biased dataset)-undersampling, oversampling, SMOT)
-python libraries

**Supervised Learning**
-Regression & Classification
-Regression-Linear, Polynomial, Lasso, Ridge, SVR, KNN, Boosting Regressor, Random Forest(bagging),Elastic net
-Classification: Tree based model- Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra Trees, Gradient boosting, XGboost, ADaboost, Light GBM, Catboost
-KNN classifier
-LR
-SVC
-Nyvebased
-Ensemble learning (bagging and boosting), stacking

**Model Evaluation-Spervised**

-Biased variance trade off
-crosss validation (k-fold, stratified k-fold, time series split)
-confusion matrix (classification- accuracy, AUC, ROC, F1 score)
-model evaluation for regression (MSE, MASE, R2)

**Unsupervised**
-Clustering
-PCA

**Model Tuning**
-hyper parameter tuning
-grid search
-random search
-genetic algorithm
-Bayesian optimization



**Deep Learning**
-Image processing; Sequence Model;
-ANN
-Nueral Network architecture
-Activation function- LR
-Loss function-MSE/MASE
-Optimizers
-Forward/backpropagation
-vanishing and exploding gradient
-overfitting

-Image and computer vision backbone- CNN
-pretrained model- transfer learning

**Text Data**
-RNN, GRU, BERT- sequence model
-text processing


**Deatils of Machine Learning**
-Train Data (Use algorithm and labelling)
-We got train model
-Types: Disciminative model and Generative Model
-Learning types: Supervised, Unsupervised and reinforcement learning
-Supervised: classification task- black color fruit and green color fruit labelling. New fruit what types. For this problem need to be supervised.
-Supervised two category. One is classification and another one is regression. If output will be continuous number based on some factor, it will be regression. It has dependednt and dependednt.
-Unsupervised: based on characterstics divide them in cluster.
-these are discriminative concept

-Summmary: Supervised has labelled and unsupervised not have labeled.

-Generative AI- train model with the large data, train the model such that model can provide the information using the previous information-LLM

**Steps of ML**

1. Problem deifintiion
2. Data collection
3. Model selection and particular alogrithm
4. Model Training
5. Evaluate the model- how properly it can give correct ans
6. Model Fine tuning-enahnce the performance by finding the optimum
7. Deployment- Which cloud or service
