# Machine-Learning
Introduction to Machine Learning

I prepared this project as a part of my research tool. My approach will AI-ML-DL-Gen AI
Machine Learning- Works with Data

**Preporcessing and feature engineering**

-Real world data before feeding- feature engineering(raw data-encodding(categorical data like text data-yes/no data need encoding-label encoding/one hot encoding/ordinal encoding/binaryencoding/frequency encoding)  & binning (catgorical analysis)
-Scaling and Transformation- If numerical data in large number, need scaling. It helps faster calculation. Like standard scale, minmax scaler,robust scaler (outlier remove),maxabs scaler,log transformation (outlier and skewed data control), power transformation
-Text processing (Regex, Stemming,Tokenization, pos tagging, stop-word removal), and represtent in vectorization-(count, Tf-IDF, word to Vec, BERT Embedding).
-Dim reduction(PCA, filter method,embedded method, wrapper method)
-Feature creation(mathmetical combination, interaction, aggregation)- example- day, month, year separation.
-If imbalance data (increase pattern leads to biased dataset)-undersampling, oversampling, SMOT)
-python libraries

**Supervised Learning**
-Regression & Classification
-Regression-Linear, Polynomial, Lasso, Ridge, SVR, KNN, Boosting Regressor, Random Forest(bagging),Elastic net
-Classification: Tree based model- Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra Trees, Gradient boosting, XGboost, ADaboost, Light GBM, Catboost
-KNN classifier
-LR
-SVC
-Nyvebased
-Ensemble learning (bagging and boosting)
